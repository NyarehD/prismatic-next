# Prismatic Next
### An experimental full-stack project with NextJS with the help of Prisma.
This is an experimental project to test how can NextJS be full-stack without the help of backend api such as Laravel.
When deployed, it is going with Planetscale, a MySQL provider. But currently, it is being developed with local MySQL.

The reason I didn't go with Firebase or Supabase is that I am already familiar with MySQL and ORMs, so no need to go serverless.


### Tech Stacks
